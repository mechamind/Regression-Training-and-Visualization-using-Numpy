# Third Order Polynomial Regression Training and Visualization using Numpy
This Python script demonstrates 3rd order polynomial regression using Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook. Here's what the script does:
- Generates random noisy data based on a sine wave.
- Performs polynomial regression to fit a 3rd order polynomial curve to the data.
- Shows the derivation of the equations used in the regression.
- Displays the regression curve as an animation in the notebook.
